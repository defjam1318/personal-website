    <p>Toma Iliev is a violinist focused on historically informed performance. Holder of the Ruth and Charles Poindexter
      chair with the Portland Baroque Orchestra, recent engagements include performances with Philharmonia Baroque
      Orchestra, American
      Bach Soloists, Oregon Bach Festival, Indianapolis Baroque Orchestra, Clarion Music Society, and the Valley of the
      Moon Festival, as well as broadcasts on MediciTV, BBC3 radio, WQXR, and the CBC “Rush Hour” series.</p>
    <p>An avid chamber musician, Toma is a member of the Renaissance ensemble Sonnambula, who held the position of
      2018-19 artists in residence of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. Toma was the winner of the 2014 Christa
      Bach-Marschall Foundation Prize from the Leipzig International Bach Competition, and was the winner of the 2013
      Indianapolis Baroque Orchestra Concerto Competition. </p>
    <p>A native of Sofia, Bulgaria, Toma discovered his passion for music at an early age. Beginning hisstudies at the
      National Music School in Sofia, he later received his bachelor and master of music degrees at Indiana University
      where he studied with Kevork Madriossian and Stanley Ritchie, and received his graduate diploma from the Juilliard
      School, where he was a member of the prestigious and selective historical performance program. </p>
    <p>In addition to performing on baroque and classical violin, his versatility has led him to solo and chamber
      performances on baroque and classical viola, viola d'amore, and tenor viol, and modern engagements with such
      ensembles as San Francisco-based conductorless chamber orchestra One Found Sound. Having learned from
      inspirational figures such as Stanley Ritchie, Monica Huggett, Rachel Podger, Nigel North, Jordi Savall, Robert
      Levin, Richard Egarr and others, Toma has been developing his own vision of the specifics of historically informed
      performance and is focused on bringing the evolving principles of the HIP movement to each performance as well as
      music beyond the baroque and classical repertoire.</p>
